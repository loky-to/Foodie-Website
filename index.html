					<p>	The very first strawberry is almost unrecognisable. After many years of selective breeding, the famous red strawberry we know today is bright red, large and plump with a subtle sweetness.
					</p>
                    <p>These traits were used in the selective breeding process, however the original fruit was actually sweeter. Farmers preferred a large, red, plump fruit over its taste.</p>

                    <p>With so many ice creameries in Australia, ice cream parlours have started getting creative with serving their ice cream. An ice cream parlour in Melbourne serves taro flavoured ice cream, topped with popping candy, surrounded by a light fluffy cloud of freshly spun fairy floss.</p>

                    <p>Colours are as important as taste but the reward for excellent presentation is a great incentive for cafes.</p>
